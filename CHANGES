Changes:

2/12/22 		Changed boot to allow for runing to other than $8000
				Note: Now changes $FFF8/9 in case anyone is using a non standard Kernel.

8/12/22 		Split out 8042 hardware code so FIFO queue can replace it.

15/12/22 		Stopped duplicate Key messages - was sending both arrow key and keypad key ?
